## Features 

- **JWT Authentication & Authorization**: Secure token-based authentication with a custom filter that validates requests and extracts user information. Supports three role levels (USER, ADMIN, OWNER) with role-based access control.
- **User Account Management**: Registration with email validation using regex patterns, password hashing with BCrypt, and secure session management.
- **Room Management API**: Complete CRUD operations for rooms including adding new rooms, updating details (type, price, photos), and deleting rooms. Photos stored as BLOBs in PostgreSQL.
- **Room Booking System**: Users can book rooms with check-in/check-out dates, guest information, and party size. Automatic confirmation code generation and real-time availability tracking.
- **Photo Handling**: Room photos stored as BLOBs in the database with Base64 encoding for frontend consumption. Transactional support for large object operations.
- **Custom Exception Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions for invalid passwords, missing resources, photo retrieval issues, and user account errors.
- **CORS Configuration**: Configured to work seamlessly with frontend applications running on different ports and origins.
- **Layered Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with controllers, services, and repositories following best practices for maintainability and testability.

### Authentication Flow
1. User registers with email, password, and full name
2. Email is validated using regex pattern
3. Password is hashed with BCrypt before storage
4. On login, JWT token is generated with user role and info as claims
5. Token is included in Authorization header for protected endpoints
6. Custom filter validates token on each request

### Security
- Public endpoints: `/auth/**`, `/rooms/all-rooms`
- Protected endpoints: `/rooms/bookings/**`, `/rooms/browse-rooms/booking/**`
- Role-based access: Different permissions for USER, ADMIN, and OWNER roles
- CORS enabled for frontend integration on localhost:5173 and localhost:3000
